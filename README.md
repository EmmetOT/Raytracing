# Raytracing
Implementing the raytracing as described in the book "Raytracing in One Weekend".

This was pretty fun - right now I just have the basic sphere stuff, with lambertian, specular, and dielectric materials, as well as lights.

The big take home was "wow, it's really that simple?" 

I think I'd like to do this again but my own way, and parallelized on the GPU!
